"There's a clear link between an African mask, a romantic piece of furniture and a Matisse painting. Each is mysterious and strong, two essential qualities for happiness and beauty', said Helena Rubinstein to anybody who questioned her reasoning for her love of artwork. As one of her favorite pastimes, the beauty queen relished collecting fine pieces of art and was a patron for the industry.

A woman ahead of her time

On top of being considered a bold pioneer in many fields, Helena Rubinstein also had a real passion for art and quickly became an esteemed collector. Although she was known to snap up large numbers of artwork in the blink of an eye, she did so with precision and was selective about her choices. Attracted by avant-garde pieces and African art, she was one of the first individuals globally to procure and display them in her many apartments. One of her favorite pieces was the Bangwa Queen, a Cameroonian statuette dating from the mid-18th century. Her primitive art pieces were so famous that the New York Museum of Modern Art borrowed her collection as part of a major traveling exhibition in 1935\. As usual, her vision for future trends and valuable art was spot-on; African Art is now one of the most collected genres on the market.

Helena Rubinstein, the patron

The beauty expert did not consider herself a collector. She preferred to support and launch artist's careers, trusting her instincts more than what was considered fashionable at the time. Throughout her life, she created various art foundations and set aside part of her fortune for patronage. It is thanks to her donations that the Helena Rubinstein Pavilion for Contemporary Art museum opened its doors to the public in 1959 in Tel Aviv, Israel.

A patron from the very beginning, Helena Rubinstein was linked to some of the most prestigious 20th century artists, mixing her admiration of their work with true, lasting friendships. She was also the muse of many famous painters and sculptors from around the world. She expressed her passion and love of art wherever she went and in many of her own projects.

ARTS/ARTIFACTS; From Africa, a Sophisticated Lady of Rhythm

By RITA REIF 

Published: April 30, 1995

AS MOST COLLECTORS KNOW, THE RIGHT owner's name in the pedigree of an object adds luster to its value: the Duchess of Windsor in emeralds and pearls, Andy Warhol in cookie jars, the Rothschilds in 18th-century French furniture. 

To aficionados and auctioneers of African art, today's magical name is Helena Rubinstein. Twice in this century, an exuberant Cameroon carving of a Bangwa queen, owned for 30 years by the cosmetics tycoon, brought the highest price ever for African art at Sotheby's auctions in New York: $29,000 in 1966 and $3.4 million in 1990, the current record. 

Now another important African work from the Rubinstein collection, a Senufo sculpture of a woman from the Ivory Coast, will go on sale, on Friday at Christie's in New York. The piece is a century-old ceremonial work, a three-foot-high "rhythm pounder" that was used in ritual dances. It was also in the Rubinstein estate sale in 1966 (Rubinstein had died at age 94) and was bought then by Sidney Janis, a Manhattan art dealer, for $27,000\. Today, Christie's looks for the piece to bring $1.5 million to $2.5 million. 

Cameroon-Nweh/Bangwa People: Origin of modern humans?

Cameroon-Nweh/Bangwa, Mbo Yemba people: origin of modern humans?

A new study published in March 2013 in the American Journal of Human Genetics,has placed the  Bangwa ,

the Mbo and  the Yemba people based  in southwest and west Regions of Cameroon  at the origin of modern humans. This discovery was developed and published by scientists and geneticists of the University of Arizona, USA after the analysis of the DNA of an Africa American who submitted his DNA for tests so as to trace his family roots. They found that the male Y-chromosome found in this individual dates back to 338,000 years. Y chromosome are the hereditary factor that determine male sex. Unlike autosomal chromosomes, the Y and Mitochondrial chromosome do not mix during meiosis meaning that except for mutations, the Y haplotype remains constant from generation to generation thus enables an analysis to trace family roots. This findings pushes back by 138,000 years, the time that scientist previously believed modern humans first evolved. It's worth noting that this discovery and subsequent publication was a completion of the work of Bonnie. Schrack, citizen scientist, Stanislaw  Pietrzak, a polish Catholic priest and T. Krahn,  who owns a testing laboratory in Houston Texas.

The study was headed by University of Arizona Professor Fernando Mendez and colleagues. They also analyzed more than 240.000 base pairs of the Y chromosome before finally publishing their findings in the American Journal of Human Genetics early 2013\.

This discovery also pushes back the time when modern humans evolved from early hominids by 70% and put the people of Fontem (Bangwa/Newh), the Mbo and Yemba people at the origin of modern humans at least for now. Samples from these individuals matched the Y chromosome DNA of 11 men (ancestors), some of whose names according to Stanislaw Pietrzak include: 

Mbekem b. 1875, Fontem

Atabong b. 1862, \> Tanjuateh b. 1895, Fontem, Azi

Mbenzefeh b. 1888, Fontem

Ncheanzach TABI b. 1894, Mamfe

Tatuch b. 1903, Fontem

Tatych b. 1903, Fontem

Tatuch Anutechia b.1885, Fontem

George Techoukwi b. 1895, Fontem

Forethia b. 1885, Fontem

Emetem b. 1858, \> Njualem Nwedlataw, Fontem

Aminde b. 1897, Fontem

Atemkeng b. 1846, \> Thomas Ngwondong, Fontem, Lewoh.

Mbeh NtonGhawaH b. 1905, Fontem

Bangwa people, who  are also known as the Nweh people comprise all villages in Fontem subdivision such as Lebang, Essoh-Attah and others in Alou sub division such as, Lewoh,  Nwametaw, Ndungated etc in  Lebialem, Cameroon, Africa.  Bangwa  Mbo and Yemba ( bamileke)  people all share common boundaries. They also have  similar cultural heritage.

This is what Dr Schrack had to say "Another thing I might mention is that our African American project members are a far closer match to the Bangwa people, whose haplotypes are found in the SMGF database...than to the Mbo who were sequenced. The Bangwa and Mbo are close neighbors, and rivals...when talking about who our project member's kinfolk in Africa might be, it's a far better chance they're Bangwa, from Fontem, Lebialem, than Mbo. We found two SNPs in our project members that were negative in the Mbo -- perhaps they'd be found positive if Bangwa were tested.

Ever since this discovery, Polish clergy and philanthropist Stanislaw Pietrzak has been mobilizing funds to assist people of Y chromosome or AOO Adam in the Fontem/Nweh area. The funds which have been and continue to be channeled to Agendia  Aloysius, have been used to help needy families subsidise the education of theirs kids as well as pay for some medical bills.
