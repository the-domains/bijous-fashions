SAN FRANCISCO --- Akilah Johnson, a 10th grader from Washington, D.C., is Google's top student doodler.
Johnson's doodle, which honors her African-American heritage, is featured prominently on the Internet giant's home page on Monday. It was selected from 100,000 submissions to the "Doodle 4 Google" competition for young artists.

This year, Google asked students from kindergarten to 12th grade to doodle "What makes me...me."
Drawn as a box braid, Johnson's doodle, entitled "My Afrocentric Life," was brought to life with color pencils, black crayons and Sharpie markers. It celebrates African-American culture, weaving from left to right childhood experiences and shades of her personality with such current-day themes as the Black Lives Matter movement, influences that she says made her who she is today.
"I grew up learning a lot about my history as an African American. As I grew older, I realized that the black people that came before us has made us into what we are today, so of course I had to include them in my doodle," said Johnson, who is the first African American to win the national competition.
Among those featured in the doodle are Nelson Mandela, Malcolm X, Rosa Parks, Ruby Bridges, Angela Davis, Colin Powell and Bill Cosby,
How does it feel to have her artwork illustrate the Google home page for hundreds of millions to see?
"Amazing," Johnson, 15, said in an interview shortly after winning the competition, her eyes glued to her phone as comments flooded social media.
"I didn't think I was going to win," she said. "Then when I got up there and it hit me, I started crying so hard. It was unbelievable."

Poll: Assault Weapons Are for Women Soldiers Unlike a certain formerly bow-tied genius, who compared allowing women in combat roles to domestic abuse, American voters support allowing women in combat by an overwhelming 75 percent, including 77 percent among women, 86 percent among Democrats and a not-too-shabby 63 percent among Republicans.
