Dark Chocolate ..
Poem Details | by David Meade | 
Magic Beans
Our first awareness
falling through time
through blood-rain, pure white snow, green vegetation 
down into deep earth
warm sunshine
cool wind
soaking rain
Energy flowing-up through our pod
each day we grew bigger
snug together with brothers and sisters
bursting our little cozy shell
then one day
a father and daughter
plucked us from the vine
stripped -- we lay bare upon a tray
disorientated and tender but alive 
a life force deep inside us
our skin soft but hardening 
then sleep waiting for the one
Daddy!! Come see the beans
They changed colors
I see brown ones with white specks
Yellow with black dots
Orange with blue stripes 
But wait there are three larger beans that seem to glow and vibrate
one is blood-red
another brilliant white
the last forest green
What does this mean daddy?
Is it evil?
No my sweet darling
These are special beans
Descended from an ancient garden long ago 
no longer of this world
It was a place of love and light
No death but a deep communion between mother earth and us
The three beans are: Peace, Purity, Prosperity 
These beans will feed a starving world 
Bring healing to the hurting
Laughter to the downtrodden 
Hope to the desolate 
Love to the unloved 
Life to the dead
These beans hold deep magic
How do they work Daddy?
a worthy woman is chosen
who is humble of heart
strong in spirit
wise in love 
Who is this lady?
the magic beans choose
they only appear to the one female
you, my darling you are the one
Me? I am only a girl
I have none of these things 
the beans see deep within a soul
they never lie
they have chosen you 
together you will change the world!
Daddy, I am scared
I am shaking 
I am not worthy
breathe deeply, close your eyes 
put the beans in your mouth
Daddy, I taste sweetness
Molasses, ginger, caramel now chocolate 
I see visions upon the wind
Blood, wars, rage, yelling unbearable things
yes, darling the evil is strong here
let the blood from the red bean flow
let it mingle with your love
it will defeat this evil and bring
healing and forgiveness peace
The white bean is singing with my voice -- Daddy!
Sweet is her song
I see merriment, laugher, dancing 
People hugging and holding hands
My tears are falling
Filling rivers with waters of light, love and purity
Joy reverberates from mountains peaks
From my open lips runs rich green sap
Deep does the earth drink
Big drafts of life and love
I see fields flowing with
Cream, honey, and wine
Trees waving to the sun
The earth is rejoicing
I see beans being planted 
In a garden
A man and a little girl
yes, my Little One, soar now
fill the world with your love
fill the wind with your song
love generously 
Such is the magic of these colored beans
