At April

Toss your gay heads,  
Brown girl trees;  
Toss your gay lovely heads;  
Shake your brown slim bodies;  
Stretch your brown slim arms;  
Stretch your brown slim toes.  
Who knows better than we,  
With the dark, dark bodies,  
What it means  
When April comes a-laughing and a-weeping  
Once again  
At our hearts?

Written by Angelina W. Grimke (1880-1958)
