\#BeautifulAfrica Mother Elder We celebrate Women's History... we remember the beautiful and blessed 'mother wit' guidance we got from our grandmothers, our mothers, our aunts, our 'play mothers', our teachers... all the women who have lived long and well and who have helped all our lives long.
This beautiful mother elder is from Lesotho, a nation in the Southern region of the African Continent.
