The first way is to be better at something than anyone else ever was. Michael Jordan, for example, is a legendary basketball player. The
    other way is to be knownâand yet remain mysteriousâfor a very long time. The legendary Loch Ness Monster, for example, is very well known for a creature that (almost?) no one has ever actually seen.</p><p>Yennenga Was a legendary princess, considered the mother of the Mossi people of Burkina Faso. She was a famous warrior whose son Ouedraogo founded the Mossi Kingdoms.Yennenga was the daughter of Nedega, an early 12th-century king of the Dagomba Kingdom
    in what is now northern Ghana.[2] She was a beautiful and beloved princess who from the age of 14, fought in battle for her father against the neighbouring MalinkÃ©s. Skilled with javelins, spears and bows, she was an excellent horsewoman and commanded
    her own battalion. Yennenga was such an important fighter that when she reached a marriageable age, her father refused to choose a husband for her or allow her to marry. To express her unhappiness to her father, Yennenga planted a field of wheat.
    When the crop grew, she let it rot. She explained to her father that that was how she felt, being unable to marry. Nedega failed to be moved by this gesture and locked his daughter <a href="http://up.One" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">up.One</a>    of the king's horsemen helped Yennenga, dressed as a man, escape on her stallion. Attacked by MalinkÃ©s, her companion was killed, and Yennenga was left alone. She continued to ride north. One night, when she was exhausted from crossing a river, Yennenga's
    stallion took her into a forest. She met a solitary elephant hunter called Riale. When he saw through Yennenga's disguise, they fell in love. Yennenga and Riale had a son they named Ouedraogo, which means "stallion" and is now a common name in Burkina
    Faso.Yennenga is considered by the Mossi to be the mother of their empire and many statues of her can be found in the capital city of Burkina Faso, Ouagadougou. A statue of a golden stallion, called the Ãtalon de Yennenga, is awarded as the first
    prize in the biennial Panafrican Film and Television Festival of Ouagadougou (FESPACO).

She is best known for designing Jacqueline Kennedy's wedding dress. Ann never repeated a design, every
    dress was an original. There were 50 yards of silk taffeta, with a very full circular skirt tucked and pleated (Lowe's specialty). The dress Anne Lowe designed for Jacqueline Kennedy is the most photographed wedding dress in history. The dress is
    housed in the Kennedy Library in Boston and was shown to the world September 12, 1953. It has been 58 years since then. Anne Cole Lowe was born 1898 in Clayton, AL. She was the great granddaughter of an eslaved African and a planter. Ann married in
    1912 at 14 years old and when she was 16, her mother passed. Her mother was a designer as well and after she passed Anne completed her projects. Anne enrolled in a fashion school in NYC in 1917 where she was shunned by her white classmates. After
    graduation opened a salon in Tampa, FL and returned to NY in 1928. After returning to NY she worked on commission for stores such as Chez Sonia. In 1946, Anne designed the dress Olivia de Havilland wore to accept the Academy Award for Best Actress.
    Even though Anne designed the dress the name on it was Sonia Rosenberg. Her customers also included the DuPonts, Roosevelts, Posts, Biddles, Rockefellers, Auchinclosses, and other families listed in the Social Register. She was known as âsocietyâs
    best kept secretâ because she was a Black woman. A ruptured water line flooded her store 10 days before Jacqueline Bouvierâs wedding destroying the dress and others made for the occasion. It is astonishing that Anne Lowe managed to remake all the
    dresses before the wedding. She worked her later years at Saks Fifth Avenue and was featured in a 1960 advertisement. Anne continued to design through 1960 for Madeline Couture. In 1962, Anne lost an eye to glaucoma and her store to back taxes. Anne
    woke up the day after her surgery to discover an anonymous benefactor paid all her debts. She briefly operated Anne Lowe originals in Madison Ave in New York. Anne developed cataracts in her other eye, luckily surgery saved the eye. She retired in
    the â70s and passed in 1981.</p></div><div class="fl-l t-0 ms-p-2 w-20" data-reactid="115"><!-- react-empty: 116 --></div></section><section id="section-h_GraphicalLargeColumn-db91380b-9e85-4c0b-8317-b98940f6d6b4" class="Section Section--components-1 color-title color-bg section-bgcover-wo title-size-medium p-0 text-align-center group-order-normal  colors-dark colors-global " data-reactid="117"><div class="Component ms-fx-r fx-w-w j-c-between a-i-stretch" data-reactid="118"><div class="Group Group--graphical p-0 fx-b-66p w-100p ms-w-66p" data-reactid="119"><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/522206519262430824/" class=" " data-reactid="120"><div class="Cover ov-h" data-reactid="121"><picture class="min-h-80px" data-reactid="122"><source media="(min-width: 1440px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/ff03f9e9767439bdec73ab70e9b8fbe5/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fthe-grid-img%2Fp%2F5ac189c15fa0bb1e66e3d99e424d2bc7def49f72.jpg&amp;width=564" style="object-position:50% 11.708860759493671%;" data-reactid="123"/><source media="(min-width: 1280px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/ff03f9e9767439bdec73ab70e9b8fbe5/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fthe-grid-img%2Fp%2F5ac189c15fa0bb1e66e3d99e424d2bc7def49f72.jpg&amp;width=564" style="object-position:50% 11.708860759493671%;" data-reactid="124"/><source media="(min-width: 720px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/ff03f9e9767439bdec73ab70e9b8fbe5/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fthe-grid-img%2Fp%2F5ac189c15fa0bb1e66e3d99e424d2bc7def49f72.jpg&amp;width=564" style="object-position:50% 11.708860759493671%;" data-reactid="125"/><source media="(min-width: 360px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/1dabe838eb6fcc0d7d63da69ae0191ef/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fthe-grid-img%2Fp%2F5ac189c15fa0bb1e66e3d99e424d2bc7def49f72.jpg&amp;width=360" style="object-position:50% 11.708860759493671%;" data-reactid="126"/><img class="color-loading" data-width="564" data-height="316" data-ratio="1.7848101265822784" src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/ff03f9e9767439bdec73ab70e9b8fbe5/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fthe-grid-img%2Fp%2F5ac189c15fa0bb1e66e3d99e424d2bc7def49f72.jpg&amp;width=564" style="object-position:50% 11.708860759493671%;" data-reactid="127"/></picture></div></a></div><div class="Group Group--column min-w-240px p-2 ms-p-h-5 ms-p-v-3 ls-p-v-8 fx-b-33p color-title" data-reactid="128"><!-- react-empty: 129 --><!-- react-empty: 130 --><!-- react-empty: 131 --><div class="Attribution op-70 font-title " data-reactid="132"><h5 data-reactid="133"><span class="Author f-s-xxs " data-reactid="134"><a href="http://www.pinterest.com">pinterest.com</a></span></h5></div><!-- react-empty: 135 --><div class="Paragraph ms-t-a-j" data-reactid="136"><p>SAN FRANCISCO â Akilah Johnson, a 10th grader from Washington, D.C., is Google's top student doodler.

A study
    of various remains and artefacts from the 4th century at the Yorkshire Museum shows North Africans were living there thousands of years ago. The most exciting results came from analysis of the so-called 'Ivory Bangle Lady' whose remains were found
    in 1901 on the city's Sycamore Terrace. Her skull was found buried with a range of jewellery including jet and elephant ivory bracelets, earrings, pendants and a glass mirror indicating she was wealthy and was of high social status.

Poem Details | by David Meade | 
Magic Beans

Our first awareness
falling through time
through blood-rain, pure white snow, green vegetation 
down into deep earth
warm sunshine
cool wind
soaking rain

Energy flowing-up through our pod
each day we grew bigger
snug together with brothers and sisters
bursting our little cozy shell
then one day
a father and daughter
plucked us from the vine
stripped â we lay bare upon a tray
disorientated and tender but alive 
a life force deep inside us
our skin soft but hardening 
then sleep waiting for the one

Daddy!! Come see the beans
They changed colors
I see brown ones with white specks
Yellow with black dots
Orange with blue stripes 
But wait there are three larger beans that seem to glow and vibrate
one is blood-red
another brilliant white
the last forest green
What does this mean daddy?
Is it evil?

No my sweet darling
These are special beans
Descended from an ancient garden long ago 
no longer of this world
It was a place of love and light
No death but a deep communion between mother earth and us
The three beans are: Peace, Purity, Prosperity 

These beans will feed a starving world 
Bring healing to the hurting
Laughter to the downtrodden 
Hope to the desolate 
Love to the unloved 
Life to the dead
These beans hold deep magic

How do they work Daddy?
a worthy woman is chosen
who is humble of heart
strong in spirit
wise in love 

Who is this lady?
the magic beans choose
they only appear to the one female
you, my darling you are the one

Me? I am only a girl
I have none of these things 
the beans see deep within a soul
they never lie
they have chosen you 
together you will change the world!

Daddy, I am scared
I am shaking 
I am not worthy
breathe deeply, close your eyes 
put the beans in your mouth

Daddy, I taste sweetness
Molasses, ginger, caramel now chocolate 
I see visions upon the wind
Blood, wars, rage, yelling unbearable things
yes, darling the evil is strong here
let the blood from the red bean flow
let it mingle with your love
it will defeat this evil and bring
healing and forgiveness peace

The white bean is singing with my voice â Daddy!
Sweet is her song
I see merriment, laugher, dancing 
People hugging and holding hands
My tears are falling
Filling rivers with waters of light, love and purity
Joy reverberates from mountains peaks

From my open lips runs rich green sap
Deep does the earth drink
Big drafts of life and love
I see fields flowing with
Cream, honey, and wine
Trees waving to the sun
The earth is rejoicing

I see beans being planted 
In a garden
A man and a little girl
yes, my Little One, soar now
fill the world with your love
fill the wind with your song
love generously 

Such is the magic of these colored beans

Anne Cole Lowe (1898â1981) was the earliest African American designer to become part of the New York fashion establishment in 1950. She is best known for designing Jacqueline Kennedy's wedding dress. Ann never repeated a design, every dress was an original. There were 50 yards of silk taffeta, with a very full circular skirt tucked and pleated (Lowe's specialty). The dress Anne Lowe designed for Jacqueline Kennedy is the most photographed wedding dress in history. The dress is housed in the Kennedy Library in Boston and was shown to the world September 12, 1953. It has been 58 years since then.\n\nAnne Cole Lowe was born 1898 in Clayton, AL. She was the great granddaughter of an eslaved African and a planter. Ann married in 1912 at 14 years old and when she was 16, her mother passed. Her mother was a designer as well and after she passed Anne completed her projects. Anne enrolled in a fashion school in NYC in 1917 where she was shunned by her white classmates. After graduation opened a salon in Tampa, FL and returned to NY in 1928. After returning to NY she worked on commission for stores such as Chez Sonia.\n\nIn 1946, Anne designed the dress Olivia de Havilland wore to accept the Academy Award for Best Actress. Even though Anne designed the dress the name on it was Sonia Rosenberg. Her customers also included the DuPonts, Roosevelts, Posts, Biddles, Rockefellers, Auchinclosses, and other families listed in the Social Register. She was known as âsocietyâs best kept secretâ because she was a Black woman. A ruptured water line flooded her store 10 days before Jacqueline Bouvierâs wedding destroying the dress and others made for the occasion. It is astonishing that Anne Lowe managed to remake all the dresses before the wedding.\n\nShe worked her later years at Saks Fifth Avenue and was featured in a 1960 advertisement. Anne continued to design through 1960 for Madeline Couture. In 1962, Anne lost an eye to glaucoma and her store to back taxes. Anne woke up the day after her surgery to discover an anonymous benefactor paid all her debts. She briefly operated Anne Lowe originals in Madison Ave in New York. Anne developed cataracts in her other eye, luckily surgery saved the eye. She retired in the â70s and passed in 1981.","keywords":[]},"content":[{"id":"0f14a5e8-f426-4a86-a46b-2d9baeb36657","item":"449fe256-10d9-409f-8a39-3fa4e918c6b1","type":"image","created_at":null,"updated_at":null,"_html":"<img src=\"https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/79b4bf56-cd39-49c3-a573-cb6abb1959e3.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\">","metadata":{"isBasedOnUrl":"","inLanguage":null,"starred":true,"inFeed":true,"hasPage":false,"inNav":false,"_description":"","_caption":"","keywords":[],"coverPrefs":{"crop":true,"filter":true,"overlay":false}},"cover":{"src":"https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/d1a46225b8560a9237cc6f8deb0d941b/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F79b4bf56-cd39-49c3-a573-cb6abb1959e3.jpg&width=554","original":"https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/79b4bf56-cd39-49c3-a573-cb6abb1959e3.jpg","imgflosrc":"https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/79b4bf56-cd39-49c3-a573-cb6abb1959e3.jpg","ratio":"277:166","aspect":1.6686746987951808,"orientation":"landscape","width":554,"height":332,"rotation":0,"animated":false,"pictureImgfloUrls":[{"width":1440,"src":"https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/d1a46225b8560a9237cc6f8deb0d941b/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F79b4bf56-cd39-49c3-a573-cb6abb1959e3.jpg&width=554"},{"width":1280,"src":"https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/d1a46225b8560a9237cc6f8deb0d941b/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F79b4bf56-cd39-49c3-a573-cb6abb1959e3.jpg&width=554"},{"width":720,"src":"https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/d1a46225b8560a9237cc6f8deb0d941b/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F79b4bf56-cd39-49c3-a573-cb6abb1959e3.jpg&width=554"},{"width":360,"src":"https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/256bcaf32fd16af53218a1056d7fa644/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F79b4bf56-cd39-49c3-a573-cb6abb1959e3.jpg&width=360"}],"colors":[[16,16,16],[90,64,153],[255,255,255],[150,132,190],[185,176,167]],"saliency":{"bounding_rect":[[1,1],[553,331]],"confidence":0.16453,"center":[288,165],"radius":319.558},"exif":{}}},{"id":"81aa1b6c-1358-4ef4-a14e-1c2282ea7121","item":"449fe256-10d9-409f-8a39-3fa4e918c6b1","type":"text","src":null,"created_at":null,"updated_at":null,"_text":"#BeautifulAfrica Anne Cole Lowe (1898â1981) was the earliest African American designer to become part of the New York fashion establishment in 1950.
